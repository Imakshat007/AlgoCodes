/*
We uses a sliging window and an ascii array for solution here:
- For every character in string we incement the varibale asscii index.
- check if the incemented index is greater then 2, 
- if yes then we  reduce the window size by moving the strating index untill the element count is 1.
- then we update are longestsubstring varibale count with a max check.
