/*
ðŸ’¡ Explanation (in simple words):
This program finds the length of the longest substring where no characters repeat.  
It uses a sliding window and a hash map:
- 'st' and 'en' represent the current window (substring).
- If a character repeats, we shrink the window from the left by erasing characters.
- If it's unique, we expand the window by adding the character.
- At each step, we calculate the window size (en - st) and keep track of the maximum.  
This way, we check all possible substrings in linear time.
